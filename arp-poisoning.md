# ARP Poisoning

[ARP poisoning in a switched network](http://articles.manugarg.com/arp_spoofing.pdf)

### Prep: Allow IP forwarding

Change the value in `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` from `0` to `1` to enable IP forwarding. 

### Option 1: arpspoof

If not yet installed, install with `sudo apt install dsniff`

Syntax:
```
$ sudo arpspoof -i tap0 -t <ip1> -r <ip2>
```
* for example, ip1 is the victim and ip2 is the local gateway
* this sends gratuitous arp replies to hosts at both IP
* break out with `ctrl+c` and it'll automatically re-arp to hosts at both IP

Start WireShark before running arpspoof. 

### Option 2: Ettercap

Ettercap has a lot more MITM options than ARP poisoning. 

Basics: 
* Open the GUI, specify the interface, start `unified sniffing`, scan hosts in the subnet, and add target hosts to the target. 
* Then go to MITM menu and start ARP poisoning (similarly, start WireShark beforehand)

Ettercap to-do: try [bridged sniffing](https://linux.die.net/man/8/ettercap) some time. 
> Don't use it on gateways or it will transform your gateway into a bridge. HINT: you can use the content filtering engine to drop packets that should not pass. This way ettercap will work as an inline IPS ;)
