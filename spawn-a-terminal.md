# Spawn an Interactive Shell

Typically we get a dumb shell after establishing connection with the victim (e.g. via netcat). You can't use auto-complete, can't see what directory you're in, can't use utilities like `nano`... when you key down the left arrow, it only prints `[[D` on screen... The worst part of all - when you press  `ctrl+c` it disconnects. 

The "upgrade" is implemented by [process spawning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pty.html#pty.spawn).

## Solution

How well this works depends on the victim's OS. 

In dumb shell, if the victim's system has Python installed, run
```
python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
```

Press `ctrl+z` to put the session into background, then run 
```
$ stty raw -echo;fg
```
and press enter.
