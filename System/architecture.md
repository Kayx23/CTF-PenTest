* ESP is 
* In addition, EIP (the instruction pointer) controls the program execution by storing a pointer to the address of the next instruction. It tells CPU where to go next.

* the old 8-bit CPU had 16-bit register divided into two parts (a low byte **L** and a high byte **H**)
* 32-bit uses **X** for **L+H**, or simply removes **L**
* 64-bit starts with **R**
