# Null Session

A null session occurs when you connect to a host with no username or password. In Windows, this is done by connecting to the _Inter-Process Communication share_ ([IPC$ share](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/inter-process-communication-share-null-session#about-ipc-share)). This only works on legacy Windows systems.

## smbmap
Automated tool to map share access. 

To map with empty username and password: 
```
$ smbmap -H 192.168.99.162 
[+] IP: 192.168.99.162:445      Name: 192.168.99.162                                    
        Disk                                                    Permissions     Comment
        ----                                                    -----------     -------
        My Documents                                            READ, WRITE
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS       Remote IPC
        Frank                                                   NO ACCESS
        C                                                       READ, WRITE
        WorkSharing                                             READ, WRITE
        FrankDocs                                               NO ACCESS
        ADMIN$                                                  NO ACCESS       Remote Admin
        C$                                                      NO ACCESS       Default share
```

We see that we can log into C, WorkSharing and My Documents with null credentials. 

To map with a given user name and password: 
```
$ smbmap -H 192.168.99.162 -u "username" -p "password"
```

### smbclient

**SMB Configuration**

In some distro (Kali 2021.1 included), you get an error `protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT` when you run `smbclient`. 

To fix the issue, open `/etc/samba/smb.conf` and add the following config under `[global]`: 
```
client min protocol = CORE
client max protocol = SMB3
```

**Connect to a share**

```
$ smbclient //192.168.99.162/C                
smb: \> ls
  AUTOEXEC.BAT                        A        0  Thu Feb 12 19:50:47 2015
  boot.ini                           HS      211  Thu Feb 12 19:46:17 2015
......
```

**Download File**
```
get [filename]
```

### Check if File Server is running

See NetBIOS name table of the host; `<20>` means file server is running
```
$ nmblookup -A 192.168.99.162
