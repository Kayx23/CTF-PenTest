# Manual Techniques for Pivoting
1. Tunnelling/Proxying
2. Port Forwarding

> As a general rule, if you have multiple possible entry-points, try to use a Linux/Unix target where possible, as these tend to be easier to pivot from. An outward facing Linux webserver is absolutely ideal.

## Tunnelling/Proxying
* route all traffic into the targeted network
* could potentially be tunnelled inside another protocol (e.g. SSH), which can be useful for evading a basic IDS or firewall

## Port Forwarding
* creating a connection between a local port and a single port on a target, via a compromised host
* faster and more reliable, but only allows us to access a single port (or a small range) on a target device

# Enumeration
There are five possible ways to enumerate a network through a compromised host:
1. Using material found on the machine (i.e. ARP cache, HOSTS) 
2. Using pre-installed tools
3. Using [statically compiled tools](https://github.com/ernw/static-toolbox/releases/tag/nmap-v7.91SVN)
4. Using scripting techniques
5. Using local tools through a proxy (SLOW!)

### 1. Using material found on the machine
* ARP: `arp -a`
* DNS: `/etc/resolv.conf` for Linux and `ipconfig /all` for Windows
* HOSTS:`/etc/hosts` for linux and `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` for Windows

### 3. Using statically compiled tools
On Kali: 
```
scp -i <private-key> <local-file-to-upload> username@remotehost:<directory-to-upload-to>
```
* take out `-i <private-key>` if using password
