# Pivoting in Metasploit
[off sec documentation](https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/pivoting/)

### How 
once gain access to a meterpreter, add the routing to the adjacent network we want to pivot to using
```
run autoroute -s <ip-interface/24>
```

view entry with
```
run autoroute -p
```

Background the session with `ctrl+z` and now we can go ahead to use other module to exploit the adjacent network. 

For example, to scan the adjacent network, we can use `auxiliary/scanner/portscan/tcp`
* note to self: i was having issues with the port scan disconnecting my meterpreter sessions... maybe check if nmap is installed on the victim machine first
