# Exploitation List
A summary of the exploitaion I have tried and worked well. 

### local_exploit_suggester (Lester) 
```
$ use post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester
```
* [release note](https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2015/08/11/metasploit-local-exploit-suggester-do-less-get-more/)
  > First, the suggester needs to make sure that the proper exploits are being checked for the architecture and operating system it's being run on. Then the suggester runs the checks for each matching exploit, as opposed to the actual exploit.
