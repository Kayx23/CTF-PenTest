# Linux PriEsc

Metasploit doesn't offer as many options for Linux local exploit (`exploit/linux/local`)

Google distro and version to see if there are exploits online. 

### Example

google `ubuntu 14.04 privilege escalation` 

found
https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39166

```
gcc file.c -o output
```

* add `-m32` or `-m64` for architecture
