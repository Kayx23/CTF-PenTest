# Stability
Once gaining access, we want to make sure our session is
* **stable**
* privileged
* persistent

## How

### Process Migration
To prevent end user killing the exploited process ends our session, we can migrate the session to another common process.

In meterpreter, 
* can use `migrate <pid>` or
* `run post/windows/manage/migrate` which migrates the process to "notepad.exe"

It's also a good idea to `set AutoRunScript post/windows/manage/migrate` before running the multi-handler, to migrate to a different process ASAP after opening a session.
* `AutoRunScript` can also take multiple post modules; see [here](https://offensiveinfosec.wordpress.com/tag/autorunscript/)
