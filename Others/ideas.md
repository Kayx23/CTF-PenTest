# Ideas for Testing
A summary of the things I missed in black-box testing. 

### "broken form"
There was a form with the following source code: 
```html
<form method=GET>
    Choose record to view: <br />
    <input type=text name=id value="1">
</form>
```
The form didn't have `action=`, and therefore, not doing anything. 

An idea to test if we can actually get something with the form is to manually pass a parameter (e.g. `?id=1`) in the URL to see if the form returns anything. If it works, we can further check if SQL injection works (e.g. `id=3' OR 1=1; -- -'`). Additionally, we can use `sqlmap` to map out the whole database [see here](https://github.com/Kayx23/eJ/blob/main/SQLi.md). 

### PHP form
In PHP, `system()` can be used to run command on the system. 
```
system("ls");
```
to see PHP info: 
```
phpinfo();
```
