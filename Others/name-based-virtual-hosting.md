# Name-based Virtual Hosting

Name based virtual hosting is an approach for a web server to serve different websites hosted on the same IP address (and port). To determine what webpage to serve, the web server relies on the <ins>GET Request Header</ins> client sent (e.g. `Host: <domain name>`)

For example, say there are two domain names resolved to 127.17.8.13. Usually you don't see either website by visiting 127.17.8.13. To visit the websites, make sure the DNS server / HOSTS file is properly configured: 

```
127.17.8.13    <domain 1>
127.17.8.13    <domain 2>
```
and visit by URL
