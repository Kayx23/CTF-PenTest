# VNC Decoder

Say we have access to a target host (maybe connected through SMB), which is running a VNC server. We found the VNC password hash in the registry in HEX format. We want to decode it. 

If we have Cain & Abel, there is a "VNC Password Decoder" that does the job. Alternatively, on any machine with Python2 installed, we can use [vncpasswd.py](https://github.com/trinitronx/vncpasswd.py)

### Where to find the password hash in the Registry
Depends on the VNC software. Here's a couple ideas: 
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\RealVNC\vncserver
```
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\ORL\WinVNC3 
```
```
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\TightVNC\Server
```

### Decode with vncpasswd.py
```
$ python2 ./vncpasswd.py --decrypt --hex 65B1B6E7A571DBC5
Decrypted Bin Pass= 'NBARocks'
Decrypted Hex Pass= '4e4241526f636b73'
```
* specify `--hex` when the input is in HEX
